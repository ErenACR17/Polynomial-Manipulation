# Polynomial Manipulation System

This project is a simple **Polynomial Manipulation System** implemented in **C++** using **linked lists**.  
It was developed as part of a *Data Structures and Algorithms* course assignment.

## 📌 Project Description

Each polynomial is represented as a **singly linked list**, where:
- Each node stores a **coefficient** and an **exponent**
- The list is kept sorted by exponent in descending order

The program allows basic operations on polynomials entered by the user.

## ✨ Features

- Represent polynomials using linked lists
- Add two polynomials
- Subtract one polynomial from another
- Display polynomials in standard mathematical format

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Concepts:**  
  - Linked Lists  
  - Dynamic Memory Allocation  
  - Basic Algorithm Design  

## ▶️ How It Works

1. The user enters the number of terms for each polynomial
2. Each term is entered as `(coefficient exponent)`
3. The program displays:
   - Polynomial 1
   - Polynomial 2
   - Result of addition
   - Result of subtraction

## 🧪 Example Input
Polynomial 1:
5 3
4 2
2 0

Polynomial 2:
3 3
-4 2
6 1
